                I might’ve had a *tiny* glitch in my brain when I called you "Russian plank." I swear it sounded funnier in my head, but clearly, my humor didn’t get the memo.

            <p>
                The truth is, you’re way cooler than any nickname I could come up with. You’ve got amazing style, a killer taste in music (seriously, Mac DeMarco and The Smiths? Legendary), and I genuinely enjoy every conversation we have.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, this is me trying to make up for my nonsense. I may not be the smoothest talker, but I do know how to admit when I’m wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope this silly little website brings a smile to your face, even if my sense of humor failed me earlier.
            </p>
            <p class="heart">❤️ You’re awesome, Chori. ❤️</p>
            <p>
                P.S. I promise to come up with better nicknames next time. Preferably ones that don’t involve planks.
