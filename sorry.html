            <p>
                I'm sorry that I was a jackass and I called you "Russian plank." I swear it sounded funnier in my head, but clearly, my humour is just bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                The truth is, you‚Äôre way cooler than any nickname I could come up with. You‚Äôve got amazing style, a killer taste in music (seriously, Mac DeMarco and The Smiths? shit legendary), and I genuinely enjoy every conversation we have.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, this is me trying to make up for my behaviour. I know I'm not good with these make up things and I may not be the smoothest talker, but I do know how to admit when I‚Äôm wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope this silly little website brings a smile to your face and maybe u will forgive me.
            </p>
            <p class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è You‚Äôre awesome, Chori. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
            <p>
                P.S. I promise to come up with better nicknames next time. Preferably ones that don‚Äôt involve hurting ur feelings.
